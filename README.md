Notes:
* jupyter notebook works!
* has cases were solution cannot be found due to the logic the robot follows
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How To Run:
*if output is desired in text file run the python program inside the python folder and type 
in a directory the program create a file named output.txt in the given directory, can choose 
between default values or values selected by the user, if there is an error on the input given 
for example wrong indexes the program will just fail as I did not implement error catching
* if output is desired with graphics, go to the folder called releases and run the program 
called "CS657-A1-Unity.exe" and once opened select desired values using the dropdown, as well 
can control the speed of the robot with the slider on top while running, if the user wants
to test more values, there is a restart button and the user can run a new random envirement 
given the values from the dropdowns
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Other Folders:
* the first folder contains all the code used to make the user interface called "CS657-A1-Unity"
* The folder called "Example Output" contains txt files which are outputs files the program has 
made when executed on my machine
